## [Spin coater](SpinCoater.md) ##

### Status ###

A spin coater has been constructed out of easily available materials and tested. It works well but lacks precise speed / acceleration control or a tachometer.

### Future ###

  * Document current version of hardware
  * Design digital tachometer for current version
  * Create rev 2 coater with digital speed control and ramp rate adjustment etc

## [Lithography](Lithography.md) ##

### Status ###

Successful and reliable patterning of spin-coated photoresist by projection photolithography has been demonstrated at 20 μm design rules across a 400μm circular field. The process has been shrunk to a 5 μm design rule across a 500μm circular field in tests, however yields have been poor.

The current state of the hardware has been documented to a reasonable level.

### Future ###

  * Play with optics, fully debug 5 μm process
  * Explore shrinking to 2 μm using immersion lithography and 100x objective
  * Explore shrinking to 1 μm using double patterning
  * ashaw is planning to design a laser direct-write system for mask fabrication.

## [Etching](Etching.md) ##

### Status ###

Wet etching of evaporated copper films over chromium adhesion layer has been tested on 20μm features with good yields (although it is uncertain whether the chromium was completely removed).

Wet etching of silicon with KOH using either evaporated copper or tantalum pentoxide hardmasks is an active area of work however no successful etches have occurred as of this writing.

## TODO ##

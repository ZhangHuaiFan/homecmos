\section{Introduction}

\paragraph*{}
As soon as personal computers became readily available, a community of hobbyists developed around writing code for them.
Unfortunately, despite the availability of materials, no such hobby culture seems to exist for electronic hardware at the 
silicon level.

\paragraph*{}
The nearest equivalent we have been able to find is the work of Jeri Ellsworth (see \cite{ellsworth}). Ellsworth has succeeded
in building single MOS transistors using homebrew technology, however her components are very large (millimeter feature size)
and were fabricated by using electrical-tape masks at 1:1 scale.

\paragraph*{}
To our knowledge no amateur group has succeeded in making an entire ASIC from scratch. We intend to build a simple
microprocessor, using a custom-designed standard cell library on a 25 micron CMOS process, with inexpensive homebrewed tools.
Several of the necessary components have already been designed and tested with great success.

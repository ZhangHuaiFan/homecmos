Jun 7 2011

Cleaned 2-inch SSP wafer (doping unknown, surplus) with presaturated Texwipe (70% IPA / 30% DI
water), air dried. Spin coated with ~0.25 ml of Emulsitone Tantalumfilm.

Adhesion was good but numerous pinholes were observed due to surface contamination. Edges of wafer
were not completely covered, not enough Tantalumfilm was used for a good coating.

Baked wafer in air for 1 hour at 200C. Film evenness appeared to have slightly improved but pinholes
were still present.

Cleaved wafer perpendicular to flat, broke smaller piece parallel to flat and created 7 dies ~2mm
square from resulting piece. Placed in gel box #5, positions A1-A7.

Initial inspection at 10x/30x.
A1: Very uneven coating, some large holes, but a few good areas. Yellow plus some purple rings.
A2: Lots of midsized pinholes. Pink to orange.
A3: Pretty even, lots of medium-small pinholes. Yellow.
A4: A few large holes, some small ones. Deep purple.
A5: One large hole, a few small ones. Even coating. Yellow.
A6: Very even, a few medium-small holes. Yellow.
A7: Extremely uneven (edge of wafer). Larger pinholes. Purple.

Coating appears relatively thick - 150-200nm.

Etched die A2 in 3% HF for 5 minutes at room temperature. No detectable thinning of film.

Etched die A2 in 3% HF for 5 minutes at 50C (water bath). Most of the film was removed, some traces
left in thicker areas. After another 5 minutes all but the thickest spots are gone. More heat is
probably advisable for future etches.

Prepared developer - 550mg NaOH in 50ml distilled water.

Spin coated die A6 in Shipley SP24 photoresist. Exposed 15um half-pitch test pattern for 12 minutes
using 40x objective and microscope halogen lamp. Developed, looks pretty sharp.

Etched hardmask on A6 in 3% HF for 5 minutes in 65C water bath. Poor photoresist adhesion observed,
hardmask not entirely etched. Baked wafer on hot plate for 5 minutes in hopes of improving adhesion
of remaining resist. Many of the stress patterns disappeared, indicating successful increase in
adhesion. (Photoresist was later found floating in Rinse 1 bath indicating thermal shock from
heated HF to cold rinse as a possible source of adhesion problems.)

Returned A6 to HF for 3 minutes. Hardmask is not quite gone in surrounding areas, needs a little
more time. Etched hardmask for another 3 minutes.

Hardmask still not fully penetrated, but PR is flaking off still. Aborted processing and returned
A6 to gel box for future analysis.

--------------------------------------------------

June 8:

Cleaved several more dies out of Ta2O5-coated wafer. Placed in gel box #5, positions A8 - C2.
Cell B2 was skipped due to poor adhesion.

Prepared 30% KOH / 15% IPA / 55% distilled water etchant:
7.5 ml 99% IPA dissolved in 27.5ml distilled water, followed by 15 g KOH under low heat. Spattering
from stirrer was observed, beaker was removed from heat and spatter removed from hot plate surface.

After cooling, beaker was gently reheated to 65C while stirring slowly.

Etched die B7 for 5 minutes at 65C (expected etch depth 2.5um). Returned to heat at 80C for another
5 mins to ensure a deep etch (expected depth 6.25um, total 8.75 um). No agitation during etch.

Very nice etching observed, snapped a few pictures. Placed water bath on hot plate to preheat before
etching.

Stripped hardmask with 3% HF in 70C water bath for 15 minutes. Some traces of hardmask left in thick
spots but almost entirely removed.

Processing on B7 completed, ready for SEM imaging. Returned to gel tray.

Removed B3-B6 from gel tray (all are similar condition; yellow with a few pinholes) and spin coated
with SP24 resist for ~30 sec. Soft baked at 85C for 30 seconds. Most dies stuck to carrier wafer
and were scratched during removal.

Exposed first die for 30 sec using new 1W UV LED. Developed, severely underexposed. Placed in gel
tray at B3.

Exposed second die for 60 sec. Developed, also underexposed. Placed in gel tray at B4.

Exposed third die for 5 mins. Developed, most fine features obliterated. Looks overexposed. Placed
in gel tray at B5. Might try etching later since the FOV ring is intact.

Exposed fourth die for 2 mins. Looks slightly out of focus; UV method definitely needs some tweaks.

Hard baked B6 at 110C for 60 sec. Wet etched in 3% HF in 75C water bath for 15 minutes. Serious
bubbling of photoresist observed but it stayed mostly intact.

Stripped photoresist in acetone. Die now appears almost blank, looks like hardmask is gone. Returned
B6 to die tray and stopped work for the night.

--------------------------------------------------

June 9:

Placed die A3 (fairly even gold color) in petri dish containing colloidal silica and rubbed against
bottom of dish for 1 minute. Film was slightly abraded but far from removed. Some pinholes grew
in size. Returned to die tray.

Cleaved a small piece of <100> SSP Si from a 2-inch wafer. Cleaned in acetone and IPA, baked on
hot plate at 80C for 2 min.

Prepared a solution of 2 drops Tantalumfilm in 5 drops denatured alcohol; spin coated one drop onto
test wafer at maximum speed. Coating had pinholes due to surface contamination.

Stripped coating by rubbing with denatured alcohol and a Texwipe. Some traces remained around edges
but center was clear. Cleaned wafer in acetone and IPA; baked on hot plate at 110C for 2 min.

Spin coated using 2:5 dilution of Tantalumfilm in denatured alcohol. A deep blue-violet film
resulted, changing to brown as the solvent evaporated. Estimated film thickness 65nm.

Baked in air for 1 hour at 200C. No significant color change. Placed in 2-inch cassette for future
processing.

Diced wafer and placed in die tray at C5 - E5. Initial visual inspection of film quality: some
pinholes but overall quite good.

--------------------------------------------------

June 11:

Etched die D3 in 3% HF for 5 mins at 35C (bath had not been allowed to heat adequately). No etching
observed. Waited for bath to heat to 55C and etched for 5 minutes. Light brown areas of coating were
completely removed; thicker areas remained in part. Returned to die tray.

Spin coated die C8 in SP24 photoresist; soft baked on hot plate for 30 sec at 100C.

Exposed companion cube test mask for 15 minutes using halogen-exposure process and 40x objective.
Did not develop properly for reasons unknown. Stripped resist in acetone and re-coated. Soft baked
for 15 sec.

Exposed 10um pitch ruler as contact mask for 5 mins using 1W UV LED. Developed and hard baked for
90 sec on 110C hot plate.

Etched in 3% HF for 5 mins at ~80C. Photoresist still severely damaged. Stripped in acetone, all
features obliterated. Returned C8 to die tray.

Spin coated C9 in photoresist, soft baked for 30 sec.

Exposed 400um pitch ruler as contact mask for 5 mins using 1W UV LED. Developed, etched for 2 mins
in 3% HF at ~80C. No excessive PR damage observed. Stripped PR in acetone. Unsure if hardmask was
completely etched or not, coating is very thin and hard to observe.

Wet etched in KOH for 2 mins at ~60C. Looks like hardmask was not completely penetrated. Returned
C9 to die tray.

--------------------------------------------------

June 13:

Spin coated die C10 in SP24 resist (slow speed for thick coating), soft baked 90 sec at 80C. Exposed
15 minutes using halogen microscope lamp and developed.

Hard baked 5 mins at 125C. Slight bubbling was observed. Allowed to cool, baked another 3 mins at
130C. No additional bubbling observed, looks like resist is adequately outgassed.

Wet etched 2 mins in dilute HF in 85C water bath. Some etching observed but some PR degradation.
Much improved over previous etches, more baking might help more.

Returned to HF for 4 minutes. Can't tell if hardmask is etched through.

Stripped resist in acetone, pattern was almost obliterated. Returned C10 to die tray.

Spin coated D2 in SP24 resist at low speed, soft baked 60 sec at 130C with silicon spacer.

Exposed cross pattern for 5 minutes using UV LED. Developed but did not hard bake, returned to die
tray for future processing.

--------------------------------------------------

June 16:

Spin coated five dies (D6-7-8-9, E4) in SP24 resist. Preparation: acetone rinse, IPA rinse,
dehydration bake for 3 min on 140 C hot plate. Used low speed for thick film.

Soft baked all dies for 60 sec on 120 C hot plate, moved to hot carrier wafer for 2 min, let cool.

Exposed all dies for 8 mins using UV LED and contact mask, developed.

No hard bake.

Prepared five etch tubes:
A - distilled water
B - 3% HF
C - HCl solution diluted to same pH as HF
D - 3% HF buffered to near-neutral pH with NaOH
E - 3% HF

Heated all tubes but E in 61C water bath, etched 5 mins.

Suctioned etchants, rinsed, imaged.

A - no visible damage. Returned to die tray, D6.
B - lots of small bubbles, one big chunk cracked off. Returned to die tray, D7.
C - No visible damage. Returned to die tray, D8.
D - completely obliterated, no trace of resist. Returned to die tray, D9.
E - lots of big chunks broken off. Returned to die tray, E4.

--------------------------------------------------

June 17:

Scribed several more dies out of blank <100> wafer, placed in die tray (E7:F3).

Spin coated E7 in SP24 resist, soft baked 60 sec, exposed companion cube 15 mins under microscope
at 10x objective, developed. No hard bake.

Spin coated E7 and E8 in 2:5 dilution of Tantalumfilm in denatured alcohol.

Tested un-baked Tantalumfilm on E8 for acetone resistance, no degradation observed.

Inspected E7 under microscope, good lift-off profile visible.

Lifted off E7 in acetone with gentle rubbing of a cleanroom swab. Sonication would be preferable
but no ultrasonic cleaner was available and this was just a test.

Results were very good, took several images. Baked E7 at 200C for 1 hour, returned to die tray.

--------------------------------------------------

June 18:

Etched E7 in 30% KOH / 15% IPA for 5 mins at 85C. 

Visually inspected under microscope, some black contamination (not sure what). Etch isn't that deep,
stuck it back in the KOH for another 5 mins.

Stripped hardmask in 3% HF for 5 mins in water bath. Contamination still present, not identified.

Returned E7 to die tray.

--------------------------------------------------

June 19:

Spin coated E9 and E10 in SP24 resist, soft baked 60 sec at 80C.

Preparation: 90 sec dehydration bake at 80C, acetone rinse, blow dry.

Exposed darkfield companion cube mask on E9 through camera tube with Mag-Lite for 15 minutes using
10x objective, developed. Some areas underexposed due to uneven illumination, imperfect focus, but
most features resolved.

Spin coated E9 with one drop of undiluted Tantalumfilm. Some damage to resist observed, possibly
from solvent?

Lifted off, severe damage to film visible. Need thicker layer next time.

Returned E9 to die tray.

Exposed darkfield companion cube mask on E10 thorough camera tube with Mag-Lite for 15 minutes using
10x objective, developed.

Spin coated E10 with one drop of undiluted Tantalumfilm at maximum speed. Coverage in low-lying
areas was poor.

Wondering if contamination on die after developing is responsible. Placed one drop of IPA onto die,
blew dry.

Spin coated with another drop of Tantalumfilm, using lower speed. Poorer lift-off profile observed.

Lifted off in acetone. Decent results - film looks undamaaged, but some residue around desired areas.

Baked E10 in air at 200C for 1 hour. Some cracking observed.

Etched in 30% KOH at 95C for 5 mins. Hardmask appears to have broken off - thermal shock? Some
traces of patterns still visible. Need to try less aggressive etch.

--------------------------------------------------

June 20:

Spin coated F1 with SP24 resist. Preparation: acetone rinse, blow dry.

Soft baked at 70 C for 90 sec.

Exposed darkfield companion cube mask at 10 objective through photo port for 15 minutes.

Die slipped out of tweezers during developing and was slightly overdeveloped.

Spin coated with one drop of Tantalumfilm at moderate speed.

Tantalumfilm was allowed to soak too long, photoresist degraded. Aborted processing, returning to
die tray. Forgot to take pictures before coating.

--------------------------------------------------

June 22:

Prepared several short pieces of 406 micron tungsten wire and 5 mL of 20% KOH solution.

Electropolished one piece of wire for 5 minutes at 140 mA (2VDC) until wire broke. Looks very sharp,
almost definitely submicron tip.

Repeated for another probe. Duller (a micron or so?), possibly not immersed deep enough.

--------------------------------------------------

June 23:

Prepared solution of 4 ml distilled water : 500mg KOH.

Etched three probes at 3VDC. Nice tips but not super sharp, 2um ish.

Going to try building a more repeatable power supply in the future.

--------------------------------------------------

June 25:

Prepared several more specimens from <100> Si (doping unknown), placed in die tray at F4:G3.

Spin coated dies F2:G3 with SP24 resist, soft baked 60 sec at 80C.

Three dies had severe edge rings, stripped and returned to die tray (F2:F4). Remaining dies looked
good, placed in gel tray in light-tight bag (F5:G3) for future work. No time to run any litho
experiments tonight.

--------------------------------------------------

June 27:

Tried making probe tips again. Etched 120 sec at 3V, followed by 1.0V until snapping.

First try was decent but no record.

Second attempt looks to be 1.05 um diameter / ~500nm radius.

Exposed die F6 for 15 mins using darkfield companion cube at 100x. Developed, hard baked 120 sec at
140C. As expected, some underexposed areas due to flashlight exposure but otherwise fine.

Spin coated one drop of 30% Tantalumfilm in denatured alcohol at high speed. Coating was patchy
as expected, brown.

Applied a second coat, one layer at high speed, without baking. Coating was uneven but a bit
thicker, blue.

Applied a third coat, one layer at high speed, without baking. Blue to yellow.

Lifted off resist in acetone, looks very good. Preheated oven to 200C while processing F9,
stuck F6 in die tray in the meantime.

Processed F9 in same manner as F6, stopped before hard bake, returned to die tray.

Processed G2 in same manner as F6, stopped before hardmask deposition. Hot plate heated to 160C
since then. Returned to die tray.

Baked F6 in air at 200C for 60 mins. Looks good, some roughness but no visible cracking.

Possible test dies to do later:
TODO: after etch?
TODO: before hardmask bake
TODO: before lift-off
TODO: before hard bake

Samples to SEM image (in order of priority):
Left hand probe tip, F6, G2, F9, E10, C9, C6, E5.

--------------------------------------------------

June 28:

Brought tray 5 up to campus, temporarily storing today's runs in tray 6 until done with SEM work
on Thurs.

Processed G3 in same manner as F6. Hardmask still has strange black particles in it, some chipping
on edges. Baked for 1 hour at 200C.

Processed F7 in same manner as F6 but used one drop of full-strength Tantalumfilm. Totally black
surface, still no idea what it is. Baked one hour at 200C.

Etched G3 for two 1 min periods in 30% KOH (no IPA) at 60C. Looks good so far but needs more time.

Etched G3 another 2 mins nonstop. Hardmask appears to have degraded.

Removed F7 from oven, inspected. No signs of thermal cracking.

Etched F7 for 1 min in 30% KOH at ~80C. Hardmask started to degrade after first etch step,
thermal shock? Stopped KOH etching, stripped hardmask in 3% HF in 60C water bath for 90 sec.

Not stripped completly, left in bath for another 5 mins. Strange crystals visible. pH strip
shows slight alkalinity (pH ~9) in rinse water, this may be the problem. Changed rinse water.

Replaced acid in etch tube, stripped for 10 mins. Still not removed.

Going to repeat experiment tomorrow with separate rinse for acid and base steps.

--------------------------------------------------

Jul 5 and 11:

Imaged several samples (F6, F7, G2, G3) and one probe tip under JEOL JSM-840 scanning electron microscope after sputtering in
~100A of Pt. Probe tip was bumpy but sharp, final point was roughly cylindrical and 200nm in diameter.

Performed EDS analysis of contaminant on F6.

Results were inconclusive - one particle of brass and one of organic dust were located, but the majority of contaminated
surface showed nothing but silicon, tantalum chloride, and tantalum oxide.

--------------------------------------------------

Jul 14:

Inspected wafer test dies were taken from under light microscopy. Clearly visible particulate contamination. Current hypothesis
is that careless handling of wafer during scribing allowed silicon dust to stick to surface.

Created new Glade library lithography_tests/default_600dpi for test patterns optimized for 600DPI printing.

Lambda is 42.333um on the mask or 1.058 um on the dies at 40x reduction. Initial design rules:
* Minimum axially aligned trench = 5 lambda / 5.290 um 
* Minimum axially aligned space = 5 lambda / 5.290 um
* Minimum axially aligned feature = 5 lambda / 5.290 um
* Reticle size = 500 lambda / 529 um disk

Created test pattern: 20x20 dots, 5 lambda across, 5 lambda spacing. Printed positive and negative versions of mask.

Cleaned two dies by rubbing with cleanroom swab saturated in 70% IPA, then dripping IPA onto
die and blowing dry. Particle counts decreased significantly, nearly eliminated.

Ran both dies through slightly modified RCA clean:
* Distilled water soak
* SC1 (6 ml 3% H2O2 + 1 ml household ammonia @ 85C) for 10 mins
* Distilled water soak for 1 min
* 3% HF for 15 sec
* Distilled water soak for 1 min
* SC2 (6 ml 3% H2O2 + 1 ml conc HCl) for 10 min
* Distilled water soak for 1 min
* Blow dry with R-134A

Spin coated both dies in SP24 resist, soft baked 1 min at 55C.

Exposed 20um dots pattern on first die for 15 mins using maglite.

Developed, all small features obliterated (developer too strong?)

Spin coated with one drop of full strength Tantalumfilm, lifted off in acetone using swab. Some
residue dried onto die, not sure if this will be enough to contaminate results.

Exposed second 20um holes pattern on second die for 15 mins using maglite, developed. Looks slightly
underexposed but many holes resolved.

Spin coated with one drop of dilute Tantalumfilm, lifted off in beaker of acetone to avoid surface
contaminants drying. Results look pretty good.

Baked both dies in air at 200C for 1 hour. Slight cracking observed.

Etched first die in 30% KOH at 85C for 2 min. Hardmask broke off.

Returned to die tray, G4.

Etched second die in 30% KOH at 85C for 30 sec. Not much etching observed, tossed in another 30 sec.
Repeated once more.

Stripped in 3% HF at 85C for 1 min. Hardmask not removed, stripped another 10 mins.

Not completely stripped (but visibly thinned), out of time for tonight. Returned to die tray, G5.

--------------------------------------------------

Jul 19:

Prepared substrates for evaporation tests on Thursday: scribe, wipe with acetone-soaked swab,
acetone rinse, IPA rinse, blow dry with R-134a.

6A3-6A4: <100> Si, SSP
6A5-6B7: glass microscope coverslip

Prepared 50% dilution of SP24 resist in acetone.

Exposed an older die with 20um dark-points mask, developed. Spin coated with 1 drop of dilute
Tantalumfilm, lifted off in acetone. Pattern severely degraded, looks like it had dust under the
mask. Returned to die tray, G6.

Spin coated G7 and G8 (<100> Si) with diluted resist. Soft baked for 90 sec.
Exposed comb drive test mask through 10x objective on G7 for 10 mins, developed. Beautiful results,
except for the usual artifacts caused by use of a maglite instead of a uniform light source.

Spin coated in one drop of full strength Tantalumfilm, dried, repeated. Lifted off in acetone.
Way too much Tantalumfilm, coating didnt lift off fully. Returned to die tray, G7.

Exposed comb drive test mask through 40x objective on G8 for 10 mins, developed. Focuser drifted
during exposure, blurred beyond usability. Returned to die tray.

--------------------------------------------------

Jul 20:

Cleaved several tantalum oxide-coated dies out of original test wafer. Cleaned one die in acetone,
spin coated in 50% diluted SP24 photoresist. Soft baked 90 sec at 75C.

Exposed darkfield companion cube mask at 10x for 10 minutes, developed.

Made centrifuge tube of BOE solution - 3% HF + household ammonia titrated to neutral pH.

Etched die in BOE in 80C water bath for 60 sec. No visible etching.

Returned to BOE bath for 3 mins. Some degradation of mask visible after rinse.

Annealed at 90C for 90 sec.

Returned to BOE bath for 5 mins. Resist severely degraded, no significant attack of hardmask.

Returned to die tray, 5G9.

Spin coated second die in 50% SP24, soft baked 90 sec.

Exposed darkfield companion cube mask at 10x for 10 minutes. Developed, spin coated in full strength
Tantalumfilm. Rough dark-colored pattern again, looks like photoresist is definitely the contaminant.
Will test a deliberate mixture of the two tomorrow. Returned to die tray, 5G10.

Cleaned 2-inch SSP wafer (doping unknown, surplus) with presaturated Texwipe (70% IPA / 30% DI
water), air dried. Spin coated with ~0.25 ml of Emulsitone Tantalumfilm.

Adhesion was good but numerous pinholes were observed due to surface contamination. Edges of wafer
were not completely covered, not enough Tantalumfilm was used for a good coating.

Baked wafer in air for 1 hour at 200C. Film evenness appeared to have slightly improved but pinholes
were still present.

Cleaved wafer perpendicular to flat, broke smaller piece parallel to flat and created 7 dies ~2mm
square from resulting piece. Placed in gel box #5, positions A1-A7.

A1: Very uneven coating, some large holes, but a few good areas.
A2: Lots of midsized pinholes
A3: Pretty even, lots of medium-small pinholes
A4: Thicker coating, a few large holes, some small ones
A5: One large hole, a few small ones. Even coating.
A6: Very even, a few medium-small holes.
A7: Extremely uneven (edge of wafer). Larger pinholes.

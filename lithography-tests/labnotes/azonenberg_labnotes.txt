Cleaned 2-inch SSP wafer (doping unknown, surplus) with presaturated Texwipe (70% IPA / 30% DI
water), air dried. Spin coated with ~0.25 ml of Emulsitone Tantalumfilm.

Adhesion was good but numerous pinholes were observed due to surface contamination. Edges of wafer
were not completely covered, not enough Tantalumfilm was used for a good coating.

Baked wafer in air for 1 hour at 200C. Film evenness appeared to have slightly improved but pinholes
were still present.

Cleaved wafer perpendicular to flat, broke smaller piece parallel to flat and created 7 dies ~2mm
square from resulting piece. Placed in gel box #5, positions A1-A7.

Initial inspection at 10x/30x.
A1: Very uneven coating, some large holes, but a few good areas. Yellow plus some purple rings.
A2: Lots of midsized pinholes. Pink to orange.
A3: Pretty even, lots of medium-small pinholes. Yellow.
A4: A few large holes, some small ones. Deep purple.
A5: One large hole, a few small ones. Even coating. Yellow.
A6: Very even, a few medium-small holes. Yellow.
A7: Extremely uneven (edge of wafer). Larger pinholes. Purple.

Coating appears relatively thick - 150-200nm.

Etched die A2 in 3% HF for 5 minutes at room temperature. No detectable thinning of film.

Etched die A2 in 3% HF for 5 minutes at 50C (water bath). Most of the film was removed, some traces
left in thicker areas. After another 5 minutes all but the thickest spots are gone. More heat is
probably advisable for future etches.

Prepared developer - 550mg NaOH in 50ml distilled water.

Spin coated die A6 in Shipley SP24 photoresist. Exposed 15um half-pitch test pattern for 12 minutes
using 40x objective and microscope halogen lamp. Developed, looks pretty sharp.

Etched hardmask on A6 in 3% HF for 5 minutes in 65C water bath. Poor photoresist adhesion observed,
hardmask not entirely etched. Baked wafer on hot plate for 5 minutes in hopes of improving adhesion
of remaining resist. Many of the stress patterns disappeared, indicating successful increase in
adhesion. (Photoresist was later found floating in Rinse 1 bath indicating thermal shock from
heated HF to cold rinse as a possible source of adhesion problems.)

Returned A6 to HF for 3 minutes. Hardmask is not quite gone in surrounding areas, needs a little
more time. Etched hardmask for another 3 minutes.

Hardmask still not fully penetrated, but PR is flaking off still. Aborted processing and returned
A6 to gel box for future analysis.

June 8:

Cleaved several more dies out of Ta2O5-coated wafer. Placed in gel box #5, positions A8 - C2.
Cell B2 was skipped due to poor adhesion.

Prepared 30% KOH / 15% IPA / 55% distilled water etchant:
7.5 ml 99% IPA dissolved in 27.5ml distilled water, followed by 15 g KOH under low heat. Spattering
from stirrer was observed, beaker was removed from heat and spatter removed from hot plate surface.

After cooling, beaker was gently reheated to 65C while stirring slowly.

Etched die B7 for 5 minutes at 65C (expected etch depth 2.5um). Returned to heat at 80C for another
5 mins to ensure a deep etch (expected depth 6.25um, total 8.75 um). No agitation during etch.

Very nice etching observed, snapped a few pictures. Placed water bath on hot plate to preheat before
etching.

Stripped hardmask with 3% HF in 70C water bath for 15 minutes. Some traces of hardmask left in thick
spots but almost entirely removed.

Processing on B7 completed, ready for SEM imaging. Returned to gel tray.

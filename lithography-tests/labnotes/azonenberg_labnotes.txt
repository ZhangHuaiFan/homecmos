Cleaned 2-inch SSP wafer (doping unknown, surplus) with presaturated Texwipe (70% IPA / 30% DI
water), air dried. Spin coated with ~0.25 ml of Emulsitone Tantalumfilm.

Adhesion was good but numerous pinholes were observed due to surface contamination. Edges of wafer
were not completely covered, not enough Tantalumfilm was used for a good coating.

Baked wafer in air for 1 hour at 200C. Film evenness appeared to have slightly improved but pinholes
were still present.

Cleaved wafer perpendicular to flat, broke smaller piece parallel to flat and created 7 dies ~2mm
square from resulting piece. Placed in gel box #5, positions A1-A7.

Initial inspection at 10x/30x.
A1: Very uneven coating, some large holes, but a few good areas. Yellow plus some purple rings.
A2: Lots of midsized pinholes. Pink to orange.
A3: Pretty even, lots of medium-small pinholes. Yellow.
A4: A few large holes, some small ones. Deep purple.
A5: One large hole, a few small ones. Even coating. Yellow.
A6: Very even, a few medium-small holes. Yellow.
A7: Extremely uneven (edge of wafer). Larger pinholes. Purple.

Coating appears relatively thick - 150-200nm.

Etched die A2 in 3% HF for 5 minutes at room temperature. No detectable thinning of film.

Etched die A2 in 3% HF for 5 minutes at 50C (water bath). Most of the film was removed, some traces
left in thicker areas. After another 5 minutes all but the thickest spots are gone. More heat is
probably advisable for future etches.

Prepared developer - 550mg NaOH in 50ml distilled water.

Spin coated die A6 in Shipley SP24 photoresist. Exposed 15um half-pitch test pattern for 12 minutes
using 40x objective and microscope halogen lamp. Developed, looks pretty sharp.

Etched hardmask on A6 in 3% HF for 5 minutes in 65C water bath. Poor photoresist adhesion observed,
hardmask not entirely etched. Baked wafer on hot plate for 5 minutes in hopes of improving adhesion
of remaining resist. Many of the stress patterns disappeared, indicating successful increase in
adhesion. (Photoresist was later found floating in Rinse 1 bath indicating thermal shock from
heated HF to cold rinse as a possible source of adhesion problems.)

Returned A6 to HF for 3 minutes. Hardmask is not quite gone in surrounding areas, needs a little
more time. Etched hardmask for another 3 minutes.

Hardmask still not fully penetrated, but PR is flaking off still. Aborted processing and returned
A6 to gel box for future analysis.

Scheduled for June 8:

Prepared 30% KOH / 15% IPA / 55% distilled water etchant:
15 g KOH dissolved in 27.5ml distilled water, followed by 7.5 ml 99% IPA.

Etched die A7 for 5 minutes at 85C (expected etch depth 6um).

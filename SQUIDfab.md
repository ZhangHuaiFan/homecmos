This page talks about the fabrication of SQUIDs in detail and shows some circuits using SQUIDs

I haven't been active on this page for a long time. Currently, I am working on getting basic stuff back up after a whole lot of changes like the closure of the lab I used to have. Some of the issues I encountered include getting contaminants out from commercial cleaning products that use HF.

I'll try to get up some pictures of a design up in the next week or two.

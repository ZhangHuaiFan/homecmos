\section{Introduction and related work}
\paragraph*{}
The goal of this work was to design and fabricate a MEMS comb drive at 10$\mu m$ pitch using
equipment and supplies available to a dedicated hobbyist. By doing this, the author hopes to remove
the stigma of difficulty traditionally associated with microfabrication and increase interest in the
subject among amateurs.

\paragraph*{}
\cite{OfficePrint} describes a method for using a 600dpi laser printer and photographic reduction to
create photomasks for large-feature-size lithography. This method still requires the use of a
contact aligner in a cleanroom for exposure, however. The author improved on this method in
\cite{DiyFab} by printing on overhead transparency film and performing the reduction with a
modified metallurgical microscope to get slightly smaller feature sizes.

\section{Process outline}

\subsection{Hardmask}
\paragraph*{}
One of the problems facing a hobbyist microfabrication lab is the lack of RIE capability, requiring
wet etching for all patterning. $KOH$-IPA-water has been widely characterized in the literature (for
example \cite{SmoothWalls}) as an anisotropic etch that is very selective for $<100>$ and $<110>$
planes and has a much lower etch rate along the $<111>$ plane.

\paragraph*{}
Many common positive photoresists, such as the Shipley SP24 used in this paper, use weak alkaline
solutions as a developer (the author typically uses a 1\% wt. solution of $NaOH$ in distilled water)
and will not survive exposure to the far more concentrated (25\% $KOH$) alkalis used for etching of
$Si$. Thermal oxide can be used as a hardmask for shallow etches, but $SiO_2$ is slowly etched by $KOH$
and is not suitable for deep ($>10 \mu m$) etches; typical processes for deep etching use LPCVD
$Si_3N_4$ as a hardmask.

\paragraph*{}
Due to the lack of LPCVD capabilities the author was forced to select an alternate hardmask.
Preliminary research suggested that $Ta_2O_5$ might be a suitable choice as it has been reported by
\cite{Christiansen} and others to be extremely resistant to $KOH$ but can be etched by dilute $HF$
solutions. Furthermore, $Ta_2O_5$ can be deposited by the sol-gel method (\cite{Dielectric}). The
author selected Emulsitone Tantalumfilm for this experiment, which does not specifically mention
$KOH$ in the datasheet (\cite{Taf}) but will dissolve in 10\% $HF$ in 100 sec.

\subsection{Wafer thinning}
\paragraph*{}
The maximum aspect ratio achieved by \cite{SmoothWalls} was approximately 10. At $5 \mu m$ feature
size, this limits the maximum height of the comb drive fingers to around $50 \mu m$. This is too
thin to be easily handled so a support structure will be added around the rim of the device.

\paragraph*{}
Both sides of the wafer are masked with $Ta_2O_5$ and photoresist, then the back side is patterned
with a mask containing a square cutout surrounded by a ~1mm square ring. After developing and
hardmask etching the wafer is etched from back to front until the central portion of the die has
been thinned to around $80 \mu m$. After a second photoresist coating, the front side of the die is
patterned with the comb drive pattern and the hardmask is etched; leaving the thinned portion of the
wafer unprotected. The die is then etched from both sides, leaving the comb drive fingers on a
$35 \mu m$ membrane surrounded by a 1mm ring of $525 \mu m$ Si for handling.
